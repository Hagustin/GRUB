# Project-1-Grub

## Description
Grub is an app where like-minded individuals who have a passion for cooking can showcase and share their favourite recipes. Its aim is to provide homecooks with a place where they can collaborate on recipe ideas, provide ideas for improvement or suggestions for recipe changes. It covers a wide variety of audiences who hold a common desire - cooking!
